==================
Working on FubuMVC
==================

FubuMVC lives by the community, and we love helping that community grow larger
and more active every day. Once you've learned FubuMVC, you can help the community
get even better. Here are a few things to get you started:

* Join the `mailing list`_ and ask and answer questions. We're a friendly
  community and we want to maintain a friendly and helpful atmosphere. As you
  learn more about FubuMVC, help others out! We all get to benefit by asking
  and answering questions.

* Join the `#fubumvc IRC channel`_ on Freenode and ask and answer questions
  there. The mailing list is great, but having real time chat helps bring the
  community together even more closely and the feedback is much more immediate.
  The more questions you answer, the better understanding of FubuMVC you'll
  get.

* Write about FubuMVC. A blog post, documentation, anything! The more
  documentation about FubuMVC, the better.

Working with FubuMVC is great, but working *on* FubuMVC is even more rewarding.
Pull requests not your thing? Looking for ways to contribute to FubuMVC but not
exactly sure where to start? We're always looking to include contributions to
FubuMVC that aren't just code so here are a few things that could be done to
help the community.

* Blog about FubuMVC. Any little bit helps when helping more people find out
  about FubuMVC!

* Report bugs and suggest features on our `issue tracker`

* Submit `pull requests <http://fubu-project.org/contributing>` for new and/or
  fixed behavior.

* Join the `mailing list`_ and share ideas on how to improve FubuMVC. We love
  getting feedback and discussing ways we can continue to improve FubuMVC.
