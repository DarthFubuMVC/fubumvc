===================================
Getting started documenting FubuMVC
===================================

Historically, FubuMVC has always been light on documentation. We aim to fix
that oversight and make documentation a core part of our community culture. To
fix that, we need to start seriously focusing on the actual documentation
process asd getting contributors confortable with quickly adding or updating
the documentation we have.

Where do I start?
-----------------

The biggest question when working with the FubuMVC documentation is simply
"where do I even start?". That's a very good question and exactly what this
guide is meant to help you with.

What has been done so far?
--------------------------

The first thing to look at, is the documentation :ref:`itself <index>`. So far,
there isn't very much but there is always room for improvement here. Perhaps
something is worded strangely, you've found a grammatical error, maybe even
incorrect spelling? Fixing what we already have is a grea place to start so
please, go right ahead and help us fix it!

What is left to be done?
------------------------

Pretty much everything right now. We have some documentation for :ref:`fubuexe`
and Jeremy Miller's :ref:`getting-started` guide. Both serve well as how to
write the technical documentation and the guides to using FubuMVC. From these
two documents, we can come up with a list of a few things that really need to
be documented.

* Behaviors

* Conventions and Policies

* Diagnostics

* Routing

* Model Binding

* Configuration / Registration

* Bottles

* HtmlTags

* IoC Integration

Each of these sections are large undertakings, so feel free to break these down
to as small as you're comfortable working with. Even a quick overview of
FubuMVC's features is a huge help to the community and new users of FubuMVC.

How do I get started?
---------------------

You've already started if you're reading this document! From this point, there
are a couple steps you can take to get started on helping improve our
documentation.

#. Check the `issue tracker`_ for any issued labled ``documentation``. If there
   is an issue already logged, comment that you would like to work on this issue
   so we know you're actively working on it.

#. If you can't find an issue that matches what you're planning on working on,
   go ahead and make one! Make sure to prefix the issue title with ``[doc]`` so
   that we can get it labeled properly.

#. Start working on the documentation! If you have any questions or need to
   discuss with the community, please ask on the `mailing list`! We'll gladly help
   with any questions or provide any guidance you may need when working on the
   documentation.

Do you have any guides on actually writing the code?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes! We have a :doc:`writing-documentation` guide you can use to help when
writing new documentation and improving the existing documentation.
