<!--Title:Integration with StructureMap for IoC-->

<div class="alert alert-info">FubuMVC no longer supports any IoC tool other than StructureMap. We may change that in Jasper,
but for now, being StructureMap-only allowed us to greatly simplify and shrink down FubuMVC's internals.</div>

TODO(write something here)

* how fubu builds up the container
* configuring services
* the usage of nested containers for scoping
* SM and disposal
* mention the Settings convention
